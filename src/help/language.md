Early-Modern-English, the language spoken at the time of Shakespeare, is known to be more morphologically rich than contemporary Modern-English. There are also some words that are seldomly used today. We'll discuss a few of those, too. For brevity's sake, we will refer to a word in the Early-Modern-English vocabulary as an "Elizabethan Word". Likewise, we will refer to a word in the contemporary modern English vocabulary as a "modern word" or a "modern equivalent".

First, let's take a look at second-person pronouns and their precise meanings. Afterwards, we'll see how these outdated pronouns align with today's first-person pronouns:

#### Second-Person pronouns

| Case           | Singular 2nd-Person | Plural 2nd-Person | Modern Equivalent                           |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Subjective** | thou                | ye                | you                                         |
| **Objective**  | thee                | you               | you                                         |
| **Genitive**   | thy                 | your              | your                                        |
| **Possessive** | thine               | yours             | yours                                       |
| **Reflexive**  | thyself             | yourselves        | yourself (singular)<br/>yourselves (plural) |

#### Notice the similarity with First-Person pronouns:

##### Singular Pronouns:

| Case           | Singular 1st-Person | Singular 2nd-Person |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Subjective** | I                   | thou                |
| **Objective**  | me                  | thee                |
| **Genitive**   | my                  | thy                 |
| **Possessive** | mine                | thine               |
| **Reflexive**  | myself              | thyself             |

##### Plural Pronouns:

| Case           | Plural 1st-Person | Plural 2nd-Person |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| **Subjective** | we                | ye                |
| **Objective**  | us                | you               |
| **Genitive**   | our               | your              |
| **Possessive** | ours              | yours             |
| **Reflexive**  | ourselves         | yourselves        |

#### Elizabethan Morphology: 

##### Singular Verb Conjugations:

| Person / Number           | Usages with Copula           | Modern Equivalent            | Elizabethan Conjugation of regular verbs            | Modern Conjugation                             |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **1st-Person / Singular** | I am<br/>I was               | I am<br/>I was               | I prepare<br/>I prepared                            | I prepare<br/>I prepared                       |
| **2nd-Person / Singular** | *thou art<br/>thou wast*     | you are<br/>you were         | *thou preparest<br/>thou preparedst*                | you prepare<br/>you prepared                   |
| **3rd-Person / Singular** | he is<br/>she is<br/>Mary is | he is<br/>she is<br/>Mary is | *he prepareth<br/>she prepareth<br/>Mary prepareth* | he prepares<br/>she prepares<br/>Mary prepares |

In general:

- verb conjugations with 1st-person singular are the same as contemporary modern English
- regular verb conjugations with 2nd-person singular, end in ***st*** or ***est***
- regular verb conjugations with 3rd-person singular, end in ***th*** or ***eth*** (contemporary singular verb equivalents end in ***s*** or ***es***)
- irregular verb conjugations (e.g. forms of "to be") are also irregular in early modern English (e.g. art & wast)

Let's examine morphology by example:

##### Plural Verb Conjugations:

| Person / Number         | Usages with Copula      | Modern Equivalent       | Elizabethan Conjugation of regular verbs | Modern Conjugation              |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **1st-Person / Plural** | we are                  | we are                  | we prepare                               | we prepare                      |
| **2nd-Person / Plural** | *ye* are                | you are                 | *ye* prepare                             | you prepare                     |
| **3rd-Person / Plural** | they are<br/>people are | they are<br/>people are | they prepare<br/>people prepare          | they prepare<br/>people prepare |

In general: While the pronoun-form for second-person plural differs from the modern, all verb conjugation for plural verbs is consistent between Elizabethan English and contemporary English.

It should be noted that the distinction between singular and plural forms of the second person pronouns affords greater precision in the language. There are times, when studying the scripture, that this clarity of meaning is valuable. For this reason, when text is modernized into AVX by the AV-Bible application, a superscript is utilized to identify singular and plural. The superscript is provided on both second-person pronouns and the also on the conjugated verbs. That way, even when the text is modernized, the precision of the original text is preserved.

By the way, both ancient Hebrew and ancient Greek also distinguished between singular and plural second-person pronoun forms. It might be obvious to the reader, but contemporary English translations are unable to non-verbosely represent this level of precision.

##### More about AVX in the AV-Bible-2025 Application:

Next, let's examine a couple Elizabethan words that say a lot in a single word. These words are not updated by AVX modernization, because Elizabethan English also contains "here" and "there" in its lexicon.  Modernizing the handful of instances of these words would lose the more precise meaning. In general, when information would be lost, AVX modernization retains archaic words when rendering passages to retain meaning (recall that pronouns and verbs are superscripted to indicate singular and plural when modernized to AVX, thus preserving precise meaning).

| Word (adverb) | Precise Meaning    | Modern equivalent |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| **hither**    | from there to here | here              |
| **thither**   | from here to there | there             |

Finally, there are several modernizations and Americanizations that do not obscure meaning. Here are some examples:

| Elizabethan Word | Modern and/or Americanized equivalent |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **divers**       | diverse                               |
| **builded**      | built                                 |
| **goodliest**    | best                                  |
| **honour**       | honor                                 |
| **honourest**    | honor                                 |
| **honoureth**    | honors                                |
| **dishonour**    | dishonor                              |
| **dishonourest** | dishonor                              |
| **dishonoureth** | dishonors                             |
| **colour**       | color                                 |

The AVX button in AV-Bible 2025 is able to modernize the text by utilizing a singular bi-text lexicon. Incidentally, the KJV bible is sometimes called "The Authorized Version", because it was authorized by the king. The two most significant editions of the KJV are named by their publication dates, notably: the AV-1611 and the AV-1769.  Aside from a few printing-press typos in the original AV-1611, both editions contain the very same words.

To be clear, in the seventeenth century, word spellings had not yet been fully standardized. In fact, it was emblematic of advanced education to actually vary spellings. These varied spellings were many in the original AV-1611. By the eighteenth century, spellings became standardized. Moreover, English orthography was updated, during this same period (orthography is somewhat analogous to computer fonts). That updated orthography is still what we use in contemporary English today. Some letters also morphed after the 1611 printing. In summary, the AV-1769 essentially retained the pronunciations of the AV-1611 Edition [i.e. the spoken words remained the same]. After all, "faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God."  Only the spellings and the orthography were updated. Of course, a handful printing-press-typos were discovered in that initial printing of 1611. These were corrected in 1613 and obviously also in the AV-1769 Edition.

In short, word for word, the AV-1611 and the AV-1769 are the same book. Yet, contemporary English speakers might struggle a bit with the antiquated orthography and non-standard spellings of the AV-1611, but much less so with the AV-1769. In fact, the 1769 edition is essentially what we call the KJV bible today. The AV-Bible-2025 Windows app standardizes on the AV-1769 spellings and orthography.

The concept of AVX was actually inspired by the 1769 edition. The app author views pronoun morphology, verb conjugation, and the modernization thereof, to be analogous to spelling standardization and the embrace of a modern orthography. Nevertheless, AVX is not a complete translation. Instead, it is a mechanical [software/data] mapping of a Elizabethan English lexicon into a contemporary modern English lexicon. While the mapping is always precise, the transformed verses from this software process is not always sparkly clean. Sometimes the mapping generates awkward sentences. In these rare situations, AVX is harder to understand than the original KJV passage.  While AVX can be a valuable study-help for the KJV, it is not a complete edition/version of the bible.  Where AVX-modernization works, it works wonderfully. Where it fails, it's best to consult the passage directly in the KJV. To further emphasize AVX as a study help, AV-Bible-2025 provides side-by-side KJV and AVX verse-renderings. By default, these side-by-side renderings highlight word differences between KJV and AVX. In other words, AVX modernizations are highlighted when rendered side-by-side. Difference highlighting can always be turned on and off.  Additionally, words that differ from the KJV in the AVX are always superscripted (**1** means 2nd-person singular. **n** means 2nd-person plural. **3** means 3rd-person [e.g. verbs such as wouldst]. ***** means some other modernization [e.g. color<sup>*</sup>]). Only words that differ from the KJV are superscripted.

Incidentally, AVX stands for AV eXtensions.  Again, It is not a new translation; it is not a new edition of the KJV; it merely aids in understanding the very words of the very bible that fueled the most effective missionary period that the world has ever seen.

With fluency in contemporary modern English, we expect the subject of a sentence to always proceed the verb. Our minds are quite accustomed to this. This can become a hurdle to understanding some passages in the KJV. While the subject usually precedes the verb in Elizabethan English, it does not always. In such circumstances, the KJV is often more clear than AVX. It seems that our minds get signaled when we spot archaic pronouns and archaic verb conjugations. These archaic words trigger our brains to accept verb first, followed by subject. AVX transformations become the most problematic in longer passages where the verb appears first  (AVX does not alter the subject/verb order of the KJV, it only modernizes the lexicon). Beware of long AVX passages where the verb precedes the subject; these can be quite confusing.

It turns out that learning to understand Early Modern English itself (aka Elizabethan English), is best when we learn to hear/read the slightly archaic, but sacred text. AVX illuminates meaning for contemporary English readers. However, as mentioned already, it can get in the way. Accordingly, the app author promotes AVX to be used only as a tool for enlightening the language of the KJV. AVX should not be thought of as a complete or new translation. The rich poetry of the KJV is quite impossible to improve. It may be useful to quote AVX renderings of certain passages, as a courtesy when speaking with those unfamiliar with Early Modern English. Notwithstanding, there's no substitute for the real thing. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear ;-)

**Psalm 12:6-7**

> The words of the Lord are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. Thou shalt keep them, O Lord, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.
